This is a flask application. It will receive input from the URL and display the text with the specified input on the page. 
The output is as follows:

After the creation of the flask app, the Dockerfile is created, which is a text document containing the commands used to assemble the image. 
Later, I created an image, then a container for it, and finally published it to Docker Hub.
The link for the tag in docker hub is--> https://hub.docker.com/layers/sivaniraj22/flaskapp-test/latest/images/sha256-11ba1ee0d0f56146c38641c08b19ffe429c5d91abad9baffb23bcdef13b7f5cd?context=repo
